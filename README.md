* Area of interest
* Find a face
* Increase data

I have prepared a set of 60 videos of 30 people, one video with helment and anotherone without it, of each person. I've separeted them in 2 sets one for training and one for testing (70% and 30% respectivly). Also exist the possibility to increase data.
